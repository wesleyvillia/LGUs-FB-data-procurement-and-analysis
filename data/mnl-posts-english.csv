23,"alert news: vaccinations flooded due to false reports

misinformation led to the influx of non-Manilans to the vaccination sites in the country's capital this Thursday, August 5th.

most of the people who flocked to get the first dose were not from Manila and did not have a qr code or waiver to prove they were registered.

this was emphasized by the second mayor ma. sheilah 'honey' lacuna-pangan after information spread that anyone who has not been vaccinated will be picked up when they leave their homes.

""The people interviewed there said, 'they are scared because there is a rumor that they will not be allowed to go out if they do not have the vaccine',"" lacuna-pangan said in a statement.

""As much as possible we want to embrace everyone to be vaccinated, whether they are from Manila or not,"" the second mayor added.

according to the manila police district (mpd) report, the influx of people from the provinces of cavite, laguna, rizal and bulacan started at 2:00 am.

""They came in groups, they came in vans,"" an MPD investigator said.

the influx of vaccination occurred one day before the implementation of enhanced community quarantine or ecq began.

lacuna-pangan insisted that those who want to line up be informed if there are no more slots left, but people still struggle to line up even though they know it.

""the police and volunteers always inform the people about the cut off, it's just a coincidence that too many people have flocked earlier and are taking risks. people can't be asked anymore,"" he said.

according to lacuna-pangan, just wednesday night it was announced that only a few doses were reserved at lucky chinatown mall, robinsons place manila, sm manila, and sm san lazaro.

""We monitor the situation in the malls, the queue is good, when the cut off is over, we notify the people. That's all that is allocated to us so we have a cut off. 2,500 doses per mall,"" he added.

122,"news alert: mayor isko: manila's covid-19 response faster than crisis

manila city mayor francisco 'isko moreno' domagoso said that the city government has been one step ahead in mitigating the effect of the pandemic in the nation's capital.

domagoso said during his third state of the city address that vaccination plan of the local government has been created even before the spike of covid-19 cases in the country.

according to domagoso, as early as january 5, the manila city government has already signed a contract for the procurement of 800,000 doses of astrazeneca vaccines and an agreement for the 400,000 doses of sinovac was inked on april 28.

simulation exercises were also held in the city's district hospitals in order to train its medical frontliners ahead of the actual vaccination that started in march.

with this, the government was able to effectively execute a mass vaccination in its 22 covid-19 vaccination sites across the six districts while also conducting a home service vaccination for bedridden patients. a covid-19 vaccine passport was also made available online for those who have been inoculated.

hiring of additional doctors, nurses, and medical technicians were also made to strengthen the healthcare sector amid the covid-19 pandemic.

""vaccination should be faster than infection. vaccination is the solution,"" domagoso said, noting that more 600,000 individuals have already received their first dose of vaccine while about 250,000 have already been fully vaccinated.

it could also be noted that the city government was able to build the manila covid-19 field hospital ahead of its 60-day target schedule.

according domagoso, the 344-bed capacity hospital was made in order to decongest the six district hospitals and be able to return to its full function and be able to cater other health concerns.

""ang maynila ay nagpatuloy na maghanda, nangarap. katulad ng mga nabigkas ko na, kung kaya ng india, kung kaya ng italya, kaya rin ng pilipinas lalo na ang lungosd ng maynila,"" domagoso said.

""we have to be ahead of the situation. our capacity should always be ahead of the numbers of infection,"" he added.

the covid-19 vaccine storage facility and molecular testing laboratory were likewise constructed at the sta. ana hospital as the government also augmented two sets of rt-pcr testing machines and one cartridge based 16-placer machine at the said hospital.

the following were also procured to increase the capability of the six district hospitals: eight mobile digital x-ray machines, digital x-ray machines, three abbott serology laboratory testing machines, high-flow oxygenator, powered air purifying respirator (papr), mechanical ventilator, saturation machines, hepa purifier, personal protective equipment, ct scan 128-slice, and hybrid assistive limb – hal for physical therapy.

on top of this, new regiment medicines such as remdesivir and avigan, as well as tocilizumab, was made available to the public for free. the city government has also appropriated about p250 million for the procurement of pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines.

""alam natin na walang silbi ang apat na sulok ng silid kung walang gamot,"" domagoso said.

the mayor also noted that with the help of the free rt-pcr test being conducted by the city government to the public, detection of the covid-19 virus has been made easier.

""mga kababayan, yan ang patuloy na pagtupad ng aming mga pangako,"" domagoso said.

manila city mayor francisco 'isko moreno' domagoso said on thursday, july 15, that infrastructure investment in the nation's capital improved despite the ongoing covid-19 pandemic.

reporting for his third state of the city address, domagoso said that infrastructure investment reached p148 billion or a 43% increased compared to last year's data.

the mayor also said that the number of new business applications increased to 4,829 from january 1 to june 25, 2021 compared to 2,933 of the same time period last year.

the local government of manila has also collected 71.36% of its real property tax full year target for the first half of 2021 alone.

over-all revenue collection were likewise recorded at p19,177,099,394 from july 1, 2020 to june 30, 2021.

this is equivalent to a 50.71% increase compared to last year's despite the following factors: 20% reduction of real property taxes on all classes of real properties; decreased share from internal revenue allotment; and the covid-19 pandemic.

""sabi ng iba fiscal miracle daw. buong kababaang loob na sagot ko: walang himala, pwede pala, kaya pala,"" domagoso said.

""if people are shown how taxes they have paid are spent, they will pay it, on time. i say it again: the best way to promote tax obedience is to practice good governance,"" he added.

domagoso attributed the increases to the pro-business policies and programs that the city government implemented amid the covid-19 pandemic.

among the policies placed were the continuation of movement of cargo trucks in port area, the round-the-clock operation at divisoria night market, and the free offer of covid-19 testing for the private sector.

continuous consultation with business groups and the launching of manila restaurant week were also part of the advocacy of the government in supporting local businesses.

walang lugar ang kriminalidad sa lungsod ng maynila sa kabila ng patuloy na hirap dulot ng covid-19 pandemic.

ito ang inihayag ni manila city mayor francisco 'isko moreno' domagoso sa kanyang ikatlong state of the city address ngayong martes, ika-15 ng hulyo.

""zero tolerance against crime ang prinsipyong gumagabay sa atin,"" sabi ni domagoso.

""hindi pwede ang fire-aim-ready kind of justice dito. i-aresto, i-habla, i-kulong. huwag yung ilibing agad. sapagkat ginawa mo ang huli, sabit ka na sa batas, sabit ka pa sa mata ng diyos. rule of law as a matter of policy should be followed. rules should be applicable to everyone,"" dagdag niya.

ayon sa datos ng manila police district (mpd), patuloy ang pagbaba ng kaso ng kriminalidad ang naitatala sa kapitolyo ng bansa simula nang umupo sa pwesto si domagoso.

lumabas sa kanilang datos na mula june 2018 hanggang june 2019, mayroon 4,140 kaso ng krimen ang naitala sa maynila; ngunit pamula july 2020 hanggang june 2021, mayroon na lamang itong 2,755 kaso ang naitala

""tanggalin ang droga sa kalsada. pahirapan, pahirapan, pahirapan sila o kaya puksain puksain puksain ang mga drug lord, drug pusher,"" ani domagoso.

nasa 1,847 na most wanted person naman ang inaresto ng mga kawani ng mpd.

samantala, umabot rin sa 2,880 ang inaresto ng mpd dahil sa iba’t ibang kaso at 280 indibidwal ang nahulihan na may loose firearms.

“iaresto, ihabla, ikulong. rule of law must be observed at all time,” diin ng punong lungsod.
