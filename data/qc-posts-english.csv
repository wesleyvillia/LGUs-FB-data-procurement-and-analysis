while it is true that i join the rest of the country in celebrating the historic olympic gold medal win of hidilyn diaz, it is absolutely untrue that the fake ""congratulatory message"" using my picture (and now circulating online) came from me, or anyone from the quezon city government.

in a way, it is somewhat understandable that as the elections draw nearer, malicious individuals will sadly engage in more black propaganda and smear campaigns. but hopefully, you don't have hidilyn diaz to make a lie and slander me. the whole country united because of the honor he gave to every Filipino, but you used it for bad politics. It's called 'foul'.

in the meantime, let us all continue to unite behind the spirit and ideals that hidilyn exemplified, as she symbolically lifted an entire country last july 26: diligence, determination, patriotism, and the will and passion to achieve her dreams.

long live you hidilyn! long live the philippines, and long live us all."
